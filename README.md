# Diamond Price Prediction

![Alt Text](static/Capture.PNG)

üìå **Problem Statement**

This project aims to predict the price of diamonds based on various features such as carat, cut, color, clarity, and other dimensions. The objective is to develop regression models that accurately estimate diamond prices, aiding in valuation and pricing strategies.

| y       | Width of the diamond (in mm)                                                                |
| z       | Depth of the diamond (in mm)                                                                |
| price   | Target variable: Price of the diamond (in USD)                                              |

**Dataset Summary**:

- Contains multiple features affecting diamond pricing.

üîç **Insights & Key Findings**

- **CatBoost Regressor** achieved the best performance with the highest R¬≤ scores.
- **XGBRegressor** and **Random Forest Regressor** showed competitive performance with slightly higher RMSE values.
- **Linear Regression**, **Ridge**, and **Lasso** performed the worst due to the complex non-linear relationships in the data.
- **Decision Tree** severely overfitted the training data, leading to poor generalization.
- **K-Neighbors Regressor** performed moderately but was not as effective as tree-based models.
